* automated marking for A1Q1 (FindBugs plugin) (L26+)

   - check that the stmt coverage is 100% (simple grep)
   - check that FormattedCommandAliasTest.java contains strictly more than one test
   - check that each method in the class contains a call to assertEquals with mockCommandSender.getLastMessage() as arg 1

* automatic test suite generation (?)
* mock objects (L20)
* continuous integration (L23)
